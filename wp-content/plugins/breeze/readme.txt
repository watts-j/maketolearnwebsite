Breeze is a caching plugin developed by Cloudways. Breeze uses advance caching systems to improve site loading times exponentially.

== Description ==

Breeze is a free, simple (yet powerful) and user-friendly caching plugin developed by the Cloudways team. It offers various options to optimize WordPress site performance at various levels. It works equally great with WordPress, WordPress with WooCommerce and WordPress Multisite.

Breeze excels in the following areas:

* **Performance:** Breeze improves website speed and resource optimization. Other features include file level cache system, database cleanup, minification, support for Varnish cache and simplified CDN integration options.

* **Convenience:** Breeze is easy to install and configure directly from WordPress. Configuring Breeze is easy and most of the default options work well right out of the box. The recommended settings should work on all your WordPress websites seamlessly.

* **Simplicity:** Breeze is designed to be simple for all users. Just install and activate the plugin and you'll see the results instantaneously.

What makes Breeze Cache Plugin awesome is that it comes with builtin support for Varnish. If Varnish is not installed on your servers, Breeze will utilize its internal cache mechanism to boost up your WordPress site performance.

**FEATURES**

* Seamless integration with Varnish Cache for efficient content delivery. No manual adjustments needed – all settings come pre-configured for your convenience.
* Optimize performance using Cloudflare's caching capabilities. No specific Breeze configurations are needed – it works out of the box.
* Effortlessly integrate your preferred Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global content distribution with Breeze instead of using the the CDN providers' plugins.
* Trim WordPress database bloat effortlessly. Breeze's Database Options optimize and declutter your database, boosting performance by removing unneeded data like post revisions and trashed content.
* Take command over caching exclusions. With Breeze, you have the power to prevent specific URLs, JS files, and CSS files from being cached.
* Achieve smaller page sizes and faster load times through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript minification, including inline CSS and JavaScript minification.
* Load images when they're visible, not all at once, for faster webpage performance by implementing lazy loading for images.
* Load JS files with deferred loading, enhancing overall performance.
* Supercharge your site's speed with Breeze's advanced preloading features: load fonts early, quicken link clicks, and enhance DNS requests for a seamless user experience.
* Master real-time interactions with Breeze's Heartbeat API management. Fine-tune notifications, sales data, autosaves, and more to optimize WordPress website performance by adjusting API call frequencies.
* Effortlessly manage Breeze settings using Import/Export. Download your configurations as a .json file for backup, or effortlessly import existing settings to quickly fine-tune your optimization.
